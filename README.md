Vietnamese Open Information Extraction

Open information extraction (OIE) is the process to extract relations and their arguments automatically from textual documents without the need to restrict the search to predefined relations. In recent years, several OIE systems for the English language have been created but there is not any system for the Vietnamese language. In this paper, we propose a method of OIE for Vietnamese using a clause-based approach. Accordingly, we exploit Vietnamese dependency parsing using grammar clauses that strives to consider all possible relations in a sentence. The corresponding clause types are identified by their propositions as extractable relations based on their grammatical functions of constituents. As a result, our system is the first OIE system named vnOIE for the Vietnamese language that can generate open relations and their arguments from Vietnamese text with highly scalable extraction while being domain ndependent. Experimental   results   show   that   our   OIE   system   achieves promising results with a precision of 83.71%.
